; Parameters and data in CosmoSIS are organized into sections
; so we can easily see what they mean.
; There is only one section in this case, called cosmological_parameters
[cosmological_parameters]
; These are the only cosmological parameters being varied.
; The following parameters are set, but not varied.
omega_c = 0.22
sigma_8 = 0.8
omega_k = 0.0
omega_b = 0.0448
tau = 0.08
n_s = 0.963
h0 = 0.71
w = -1.0
wa = 0.0
[firecrown_number_counts]
; These are the firecrown likelihood parameters.
; These parameters are used to set the richness-mass
; proxy relation using the data from cluster number counts.
