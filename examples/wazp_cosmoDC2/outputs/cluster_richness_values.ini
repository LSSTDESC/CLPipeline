; Parameters and data in CosmoSIS are organized into sections
; so we can easily see what they mean.
; There is only one section in this case, called cosmological_parameters
[cosmological_parameters]
; These are the only cosmological parameters being varied.
omega_c = 0.1552 0.2052 0.3552
sigma_8 = 0.7 0.8 0.9
; The following parameters are set, but not varied.

[firecrown_number_counts]
; These are the firecrown likelihood parameters.
; These parameters are used to set the richness-mass
; proxy relation using the data from cluster number counts.
