; Parameters and data in CosmoSIS are organized into sections
; so we can easily see what they mean.
; There is only one section in this case, called cosmological_parameters
[cosmological_parameters]
; These are the only cosmological parameters being varied.

[firecrown_number_counts]
; These are the firecrown likelihood parameters.
; These parameters are used to set the richness-mass
; proxy relation using the data from cluster number counts.
