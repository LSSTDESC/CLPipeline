/mustfs/CONTAINERS/conda/lsst/txpipe_clp/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ceci/__init__.py:12: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81.

Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-qtl2id4i because the default path (/home1/barroso/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
